This project was making different fractal designs 

dragon.java is triangles that start off big then spiral inwards and get smaller
sierpinski.java is making a sierpinski's triangle
CoolFractal.java makes a diamond with filled in squares on each corner getting smaller every time.

all of these projects use recurion to make it so the images get smaller and smaller over time
